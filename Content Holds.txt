# Content Holds

?? Do we need to create an eDiscovery site or can we just use holds manually?

## Planning for Content Holds

Unlike records retention processes, which are proactively configured and managed, content holds occur as reactions to events, such as litigation events, that require identification and retention of materials related to a specific topic or activity. Since information retention needs cannot be predetermined, this is a reactionary process, one based on each situation's specific needs. Pre-hold planning can help streamline information discovery and optimize content to make locating it easier based on details most likely to relate to content hold needs. Taking the following planning steps will help you prepare for content holds:

### Identify the most likely scenarios for which content holds will be needed.

Specify content attributes that represent the details most likely to be used to identify materials needed to support expected hold scenarios. If, for example, you expect to need content holds for product materials, ensure that items associated with a specific product are easy to identify by tracking the product or products an item relates to as part of its properties.
